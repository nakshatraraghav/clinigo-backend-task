# Clinigo Backend Task

This is a simple RESTful API for managing a collection of books. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books stored in a MongoDB database.

## About the API

The Books API is a simple RESTful API that allows users to manage a collection of books. It provides endpoints for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books stored in a MongoDB database. The API is built using Node.js and utilizes the Express framework for handling HTTP requests and routing.

## Deployment

Project has been deployed on render.com

- [link](https://clinigo-backend-task.onrender.com/)

## Installation

To install and run the Sentrimetric API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`

### Set Up Database

The Books API requires a Mongo database. You can use Docker to run a mongo container or use MongoAtlas
Add the database link to the .env file

### Start the server

Start the server using this command

```
pnpm prod
```

The API server should now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:$PORT`.

Make sure to adjust the Mongo Connection String and PORT details in the `.env` file if you are using custom configurations.

One notable addition to the project is the `zenv` function, which is used to verify and parse the schema file using Zod. This function ensures that the environment variables are properly defined and validated based on the specified schema.

## Docker

To run the application using Docker, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image:

```
docker build -t books-api .
```

2. Run the docker container

```
docker run -d -p 3000:1337 books-api
```
